# Rewrite slides_draft_clean.md to achieve 90%+ on all criteria

## Background

Current ratings: Quality 68%, Completeness 88%, Correctness 82%, Relevance 76%, Hiring 55%, Level 62%.  
Target: all ≥ 90%.

Two key changes needed:
1. **Structural** — restructure from "analysis → conclusion" to "conclusion → evidence" (Staff-level)
2. **Content** — fill gaps in test task coverage (Q6, Q7, Q8 especially)

## Audit: Test Task Questions Coverage

|---|---------|---------------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Что делает продукт сетевым | 2.1 | ✅ | — |

| **8** | **Перенос из других индустрий** | 2.2 (Strava only) | **⚠️ GAP** | **Task lists 5 industries; only 1 covered** |
| 9 | Теория и классификация | 2.1 + 2.4 | ✅ | — |

## Proposed Changes

### New Slide Structure

**Main Flow (8 slides — sharp, conclusion-first, C-level ready):**

| # | Slide | Content | Maps to |
|---|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Executive Summary | Recommendation + trade-offs + key risk | Rewrite of current 1 |
| 2 | WHY: The Bet | 4 tezises: pain real, NE works, economics attractive, pilot controllable | NEW (synthesis of 3.2, 3.3) |
| 3 | WHY NOT: Alternatives | Explicit rejection table: segments + competitive solutions | Rewrite of 3.2 tail + 3.4 |
| 4 | WHAT: Salmon Space | Product concept + capabilities | Current 4.1 (sharpened) |
| 5 | WHAT: How It Works | Creator + participant journey | Current 5.2 (condensed) |
| 6 | WHERE: NE Loop | Engagement loop + "without this it's strange" moment | Current 4.3 + 5.1 (merged) |
| 7 | HOW: Kill Criteria | 4 key metrics with go/no-go | Current 6.1 (trimmed) |
| 8 | HOW: Key Risks | Top 3 risks + mitigations | Current 7.1 (trimmed) |

**Appendix (covers remaining test task questions + depth):**

| # | Appendix | Covers Q# | Source |
|---|---------|-----------|--------|
| A | NE: Definition & Classification | Q1, Q9 | Current 2.1 |
| B | NE: Case Studies & Core Interactions | Q2 | Current 2.2 |
| C | NE: Success ≠ Virality | Q3, Q4 | Current 2.3 |
| D | NE: Current State in Fintech | Q5 | Current 2.4 |
| E | **NE: Playbook — Repeatable Patterns** | **Q6** | **NEW** |
| F | **NE: Unrealized Potential in Finance** | **Q7** | **NEW** |
| G | **NE: Cross-Industry Transfer** | **Q8** | **NEW** |
| H | Full Directions Map | Q9, Q10 | Current 2.5 + Appendix B |
| I | Segment Deep Dive | Q11, Q12 | Current 3.1 |
| J | Competitive Landscape | Q5 | Current 3.4 |
| K | Architecture & Entities | Q10, Q15 | Current 5.3 |
| L | Freedom of Use | Q16 | Current 5.4 |
| M | Engagement: First & Second User | Q17 | Expanded from 5.1, 5.2 |
| N | MVP Scope | — | Current Appendix A |
| O | First 30 Days | — | Current 7.2 |
| P | Full Metrics Table | — | Current 6.1 (full) |
| Q | TAM / SAM / SOM | — | **NEW** |
| R | Cross-Functional Artifacts | Q15 | Current Appendix C |

### New Content to Write

#### Appendix E: Playbook (Q6)
Extracted patterns from cases:
1. Start with atomic network (small trusted group, not mass)
2. Digitize existing behavior (don't invent new ritual)
3. NE loop must require new participant (not optional social layer)
4. Social reaction must be cheap and contextual
5. Settlement must close in-product (not redirect externally)
6. Graph transfer: one user bridges multiple groups

#### Appendix F: Unrealized Potential (Q7)
What hasn't been done in finance:
- Group financial context as persistent entity (not per-transaction)
- Cross-group NE in consumer finance (Splitwise is close but no settlement)
- AI-powered social splitting and prediction
- Cultural financial rituals as onboarding mechanics (beyond WeChat)
Why not: banks think in individual accounts, not group contexts. Mental barrier > technical.

#### Appendix G: Cross-Industry Transfer (Q8)
| Industry | Case | Transferable mechanic |
|---|---|---|
| Social networks | WhatsApp groups, WeChat | Trusted small group as atomic network |
| Marketplaces | Airbnb, Uber | Two-sided value: host/guest, driver/rider → payer/receiver |
| Games | Guilds, clans | Shared goals, progress visibility, social commitment |
| SaaS | Slack, Notion | Workspace as persistent collaboration space |
| Community apps | Strava, Discord | Lightweight social reactions (kudos), shared context |

#### Main Slide 2: WHY (new synthesis)
4 tezises:
1. Pain is real: 75% harm from money conflicts, 32% never get money back, path is broken
2. NE works here: direct effect in small group, graph transfers between groups
3. Economics can work: 15M+ target demo, organic CPA via Space invites vs ₱150-300 paid
4. Pilot is controllable: 15-20 groups, 30 days, clear go/no-go gates

#### Main Slide 3: WHY NOT (new explicit rejections)
Segments: pairs (closed graph), families (top-down), colleagues (expense tool)
Solutions: Splitwise (no settlement), GCash KKB (no group memory), Revolut (no external users)

#### TAM/SAM/SOM (Appendix Q)
- TAM: Philippine digital payments market
- SAM: Social/group payment segment
- SOM: Friends split scenario in target cities

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Re-run the same 6-criteria evaluation framework on the rewritten slides
2. Verify each of the 17 test task questions is explicitly covered (checklist)
3. Check that main flow ≤ 8 slides and follows conclusion-first structure
4. Verify all new appendixes (E, F, G, Q) contain substantive content
